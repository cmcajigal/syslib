## Notes for System Librarianship

### The Beginning

1 This is rough.  
2 You've hade to delete the first trys.  
3 Cross your fingers this works better!  

### Trial and Error 

Wow! You made a whole new markdown file.
Now you need to remember the commands!
Oof! That's not easy!
Practice! Practice! Practice!

### Apache 2 

Apache 2 install worked great!
Loads of info here. Not sure how I am going to retain it all.
Maybe some sub directories are in order....

Note:
1. Use cd /var/www/html to work on on apache
2. At least I think so.
