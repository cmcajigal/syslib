#Markdown Practice#

##Here are some basic commands##

When you want something in **BOLD**, you need to encase it in **double "**"**.

When you want to use *ITALICS*, you need *single "*"*.

For an ordered list use numbers "##."
(Don't forget the double space after so it "returns".)
1. First Item
2. Second Item
2. Third Item

For an unordered list use "-".
(Don't forget the double space after so it "returns".)
- First
- Second
- Third
